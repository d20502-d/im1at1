        1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing that I paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience was the visual designs and the calendar style grid. The
        website features a clean layout with a strong emphasis on imagery which
        immediately draws the viewer's attention. Besides, the color palette is
        minimalistic yet effective, allowing viewers to focus on the context and
        not being distracted by the colors.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <p>During the two minutes, I made the following actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>scroll through the website to view the content</li>
        <li>interact with the calendar style grid</li>
        <li>hover over some images to see if they have interactive elements</li>
        <li>click on the bold text title to learn more about the work</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For this part, I spent most time engaging with the calendar style grid.
        However, I think I would actually spend more time with the project
        showcase if I have more time because with only 2 minutes I cannot really
        read through the detailed descriptions of the works so I just played
        with the calendar since it's interactive and don't need to spend much
        time to read through.
      </p>

      <h3>
        4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most common action in my 2 minute interaction was scrolling and
        clicking. I found myself continuously scrolling to explore the sections
        and projects presented on the site, and also click to interact with the
        calendar style grid.
      </p>

      <h3>
        5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience
        is to present the creator's work effectively while having an engaging
        user experience. The site is designed to highlight the creatorsâ€™ skills
        and projects in a visually engaging way.
      </p>

      <h3>
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The interactive experience communicates this primary goal through its
        clean design, intuitive navigation, and high-quality visuals. The layout
        encourages exploration also allows users to easy access different
        sections and projects.
      </p>

      <h3>
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        In my opinion, the experience should be interacted with over time by
        revisiting it to explore the updates and new projects. It would be
        beneficial to spend around 10 to 15 minutes for each visit.
      </p>

      <h3>
        8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It should be interacted over time by regularly update contents and new
        projects. It should encourage users to return and explore.
      </p>

      <h3>
        9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>It has other media forms, such as photography and graphic design.</p>

      <h3>
        10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This reference tells me that I should engage with the content actively
        and explore different projects.
      </p>

      <h3>
        11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Through the interactive elements and the aesthetic quality of the
        website, I shoud feel inspired when engaging with the research
        experience.
      </p>
